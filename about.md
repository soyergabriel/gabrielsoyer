**Welcome!**
I'm a PhD Candidate in Political Science & International Affairs at the University of Georgia (UGA). 
My research lies at the intersection of political economy, environmental politics and bureaucratic politics.


How does agrarian elites shape the fate of democracy in a unequal societies? How do economically powerful elites shape who gets what—and at what environmental cost—in democratic settings in the Global South? My dissertation tries to answer those questions analyzing the Brazilian case. In my work, I use large administrative datasets, quasi-experimental designs, and extensive qualitative fieldwork.
