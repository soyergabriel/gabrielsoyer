**Welcome!**
I'm a PhD Candidate in Political Science & International Affairs at the University of Georgia (UGA). I also hold a Graduate Certificate in GIScience (Geographic Information Science).
My research lies at the intersection of political economy, environmental politics and bureaucratic politics.


How do agrarian elites shape the fate of democracy in unequal societies? How do economically powerful elites shape who gets what—and at what environmental cost—in the Global South? My dissertation tries to answer these questions analyzing the Brazilian case. In my work, I use large administrative datasets, quasi-experimental designs, and extensive qualitative fieldwork.

My current research agenda is also interdisciplinary, with a focus on food systems and agriculture. Building on earlier professional experience, I examine how public policies can make food systems more sustainable and how commodity supply chains and corporate sustainability commitments shape land-use decisions.
