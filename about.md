I'm a PhD Candidate in Political Science & International Affairs at the University of Georgia (UGA). 
My research sits at the intersection of comparative politics, political economy, and environmental governance—
with a regional focus on Brazil.

**Research.** I study how agribusiness interests and local political networks affect access to **rural credit**, 
**environmental enforcement**, and **deforestation** outcomes. My work combines quasi-experimental methods 
(e.g., regression discontinuity), spatial analysis, and qualitative fieldwork.

**Fieldwork.** In 2024–2025 I conducted elite interviews in Brasília with officials, financiers, and stakeholders to 
trace mechanisms linking political influence to credit allocation and enforcement.

**Teaching.** I have taught/assisted courses on Latin American Politics and Global Issues (Honors), leading discussions, 
methods-focused sessions, and applied assignments.
