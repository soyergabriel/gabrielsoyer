**Welcome!**
I'm a PhD Candidate in Political Science & International Affairs at the University of Georgia (UGA). 
My research sits at the intersection of political economy, environmental politics and d—
with a regional focus on Brazil.

How does agrarian elites shape the fate of democracy in a unequal societies? How do economically powerful elites shape who gets what—and at what environmental cost—in democratic settings in the Global South? My dissertation tries to answer those questions analyzing the Brazil case. In my work, I use large administrative datasets, quasi-experimental designs, and extensive qualitative fieldwork.
