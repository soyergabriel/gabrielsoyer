# Academic Site (Scratch Starter)

This is a minimal Jekyll site using the built-in **minima** theme. Perfect for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
1. Create a new repo named **yourusername.github.io** on GitHub.
2. Download this zip and upload all files.
3. On GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**. 
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Customize
- Edit `_config.yml` (title, description, nav).
- Replace `assets/img/portrait.png` with your photo (same filename).
- Drop your CV as `assets/cv/cv.pdf`.
- Edit `index.md`, `about.md`, and `publications.md`.

## Notes
- This starter avoids plugins so it builds with default GitHub Pages.
- You can add more pages (e.g., `teaching.md`) and include them in `header_pages`.
